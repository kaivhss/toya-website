    <h2>In-depth Analysis of Toya Aoyagi's character</h2>
    <p>Since Harumichi (Toya’s dad) kept him in the house so much Toya didn’t even have enough practice talking to
        people. He would practice piano and violin everyday, pretty much never going outside. He never got to play
        soccer with
        other kids or do normal little boy stuff.</p>

    <p>Every time Toya would show some emotion and tell his dad that he didn't want to practice anymore, his dad would
        criticize him, which possibly resulted in him being scared to share his feelings. Toya clearly struggles at
        expressing his emotions. He's not cute and shy. He's awkward and clearly struggles with accepting his own
        feelings.</p>

    <p>He lacks life experience.</p>

    <p>He never really got to explore his interests or decide what he wants to do, since his dad already set a goal for
        him. He never had time to focus on himself until he met Akito. Akito helped Toya find himself and helped him
        communicate with others.</p>

    <p>His parents always made the choices for him, never letting him decide what he wants to do. His dad held him at
        high expectations because his two older brothers also followed in the footsteps of classical music (Asian parent
        core.) Resulting in his inability to perform simple chores.</p>

    <p>Toya can't even perform simple tasks like cooking or swimming. Due to all the expectations his dad threw onto
        him at such a young age and just because he didn't really get to do anything else except practice the violin and
        piano. He is still smart, but only academically and street smart.</p>

    <p>He probably felt the need to suppress his emotions because they "weren't needed" in his household.</p>

    <div class="Sad"><img src="images/Sad.jpg" /></div>

    <p>In this card, we can see his father criticizing him. Toya is holding his hand, probably because he's been
        practicing too much, resulting in his hands becoming sore.</p>

    <p>In a past story, we find out that Toya was actually interested in piano. He said: "It played a beautiful note -
        one that I would never forget for the rest of my life - like the sun softly shining through the trees, or a
        gentle breeze drifting by... it was so mysterious - it made me want to interact with this instrument more."</p>

    <p>Toya was and still is a talented musician. He grew fond of music after his dad told him that music was
        "limitless.”Except, his dad ruined the magic for him by forcing him to play. Forcing such expectations onto a
        young child never ends well…</p>

    <p>Next, I would like to talk about two of Toya’s cards. One that is decently old, while the other being relatively
        new.</p>

    <div class="Wowzers"><img src="images/Wowzers.jpg" /></div>

    <p>As you can see, in his first focus card, little Toya is in the background with no light shining on him at all.
        He’s in the dark, while older Toya right now is in the spotlight. Little Toya represents his past self. Him
        being in the dark could represent the fact that he hasn’t tried to acknowledge or accept his past for what it
        is. In shorter terms, he’s keeping his past self in the dark.</p>

    <p>We can see that they’re doing a duet in the card. However, only present Toya is in the light. It’s hardly a
        duet. He’s looking towards the “viewer” angle, barely acknowledging his younger self.</p>

    <div class="Blue"><img src="images/Blue.jpg" /></div>

    <p>But if you look at this newer card, Toya’s third focus to be exact, Toya is sitting right next to his younger
        self. He seems to be listening to his younger self play, maybe even giving advice along the way. But the most
        important thing is, they’re both in the light. I would like to point out the fact that the whole card is based
        in blue lighting. Blue can be symbolism for stability. I think this card is a nice overview of how Toya is right
        now, at peace.</p>

    <p>Flowers are blooming from the piano. Blooming flowers often symbolize new beginnings, renewal, and the
        flourishing of potential. I believe you can see where I’m getting at with this. This might be a stretch, but the
        flowers on the piano look somewhat like plum blossoms. Plum blossoms are usually connected to resilience.
        Basically, I’m saying that present Toya is proud of child Toya. He’s proud of him for coming this far.</p>

    <p>If we look to the left side of the card, we can see his childhood violin thrown to the side. Not in a disorderly
        and anxious manner, but just setting it aside. The table in front of the violin also has a cup of black coffee
        and a stack of books on it, some of Toya’s favourite things. The whole room is comforting. Toya doesn’t look
        worried, he has a calm, sullen expression on his face.</p>

    <p>These two cards create a perfect contrast proving how much people can change over a little span of time with the
        right people to support them.</p>
