        <h2>An unofficial wiki written in dedication to Aoyagi Toya showcasing his character</h2>

        <div class="flowers">
            <img src="images/flowers.jpg" />
        </div>

        <p>"I want to <span style="color:#05294b; font-weight:bold; text-shadow:0 0 6px #7cd0ff;">surpass that
                night...</span> and witness a scenery I've never seen before with my own eyes."</p>

        <p>Toya's father was a famous classical musician and trained Toya and his two older brothers in classical music
            from
            a very young age, specifically in piano and violin. His father would isolate Toya and force him to study
            classical music at all hours of the day. This caused him to despise his father, and by association, the
            entirety
            of classical music. As such, he started performing street music to rebel against his father and eventually
            met
            Akito Shinonome, a hardworking and passionate musician, while singing on the street.</p>

        <p>He sang together with Akito under the name BAD DOGS before forming Vivid BAD SQUAD with An Shiraishi,
            daughter
            of the legendary street singer Ken Shiraishi, and Kohane Azusawa, a newbie muscian looking to improve her
            confidence. Even after joining Vivid BAD SQUAD, he still operates under the BAD DOGS unit with Akito.</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>

        <p>Toya is quiet and calm but has a strong mind. His face is often deadpan, and people other than Akito
            Shinonome
            and Tsukasa Tenma (his close family friend) have difficulty reading his expressions. When people talk to
            him,
            they usually mistake him for being rude, as he is blunt and often misphrases his statements. Until becoming
            part
            of Vivid BAD SQUAD, he wasn't one to smile frequently. Despite his stoic demeanor, he is kind and quick to
            help
            others. He can occasionally be airheaded or gullible.</p>

        <p>He is good at studying and gets high grades, a trait that he shares with Kohane Azusawa. He can sometimes be
            strict with Akito about the latter neglecting his studies.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>

        <p>Toya has sharp grey eyes and a mole under the corner of his left eye. His hair is short and bicolored, the
            right
            side a dark blue, the left a light blue. His voice is cool and calm.</p>

        <h3>Casual Outfit</h3>
        <p>In his second year, he wears a white hoodie with the letter "n" printed on a small tag on the right of the
            hem
            under a green denim jacket with frayed spots, red stripes down the sleeves, and a red strap with the word
            "worth"
            printed along its length hanging from the right pocket. He wears black denim pants with frayed holes in the
            knees
            and a hanging red belt with a white stripe through the middle.</p>

        <h3>Unit Outfit(s)</h3>
        <p>His outfit consists of a white graphic tee with a red collar and a purple hoodie underneath a grey jacket
            with
            black and white accents, and black ripped jeans with a red belt and long grey straps attached to the back.
            He wears
            a long necklace with a silver-colored triangular pendant and large grey sneakers with red shoelaces. He also
            has
            chunky blue headphones. The image on his shirt shows a light grey box with a cow skull outlined in white.
        </p>

        <p>His second outfit consists of a black turtleneck shirt with faint wavy designs, underneath which can be seen
            a long,
            tattered white shirt, and gray pants with ripped knees and a blue stripe down the side of the left leg. He
            wears a
            navy blue jacket with white lapels, a blue hem and cuffs, and the word "DerMond" (meaning "the moon" in
            German)
            written on the bottom-left. He wears a long silver necklace and white-and-blue running shoes.</p>
